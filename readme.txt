    {
      "number": 1,
      "question": "Explain the difference between a stack and a queue and provide a scenario where each would be appropriate.",
      "answer": "Stack is used to store the data one by one. That means data can be retrieved on the top of the edge element FIFO. That means FIFO first in, first out. Sorry. LIFO. It means LIFO Last in, first out. When it comes to Q, it is called a FIFO, so we need to call.",
      "tips": {
        "Stack": "Use for LIFO order, e.g., function call stack.",
        "Queue": "Use for FIFO order, e.g., job scheduling.",
        "Scenario": "Identify real-world applications for each structure."
      },
      "feedback": "The answer mixes up LIFO and FIFO concepts and does not provide any real-world scenarios. The stack description is incorrect, and the queue is correctly described as FIFO, but overall clarity and completeness are lacking.",
      "feedbackRating": "Needs Improvement",
      "feedbackSummary": "Confusion between LIFO and FIFO with no scenario."

      "number": 2,
      "question": "Write a function in Python that returns the nth Fibonacci number using recursion, and discuss its time complexity.",
      "answer": "",
      "tips": {
        "Recursion": "Breaks problem into smaller subproblems.",
        "Time Complexity": "Exponential due to repeated calculations.",
        "Optimization": "Use memoization to improve efficiency."
      },
      "feedback": "No answer was provided, so key concepts such as recursive structure, time complexity, and optimization strategies were not demonstrated.",
      "feedbackRating": "Needs Improvement",
      "feedbackSummary": "No response submitted."

  "performanceScore": 30,
  "performanceSummary": "The candidate struggled to articulate fundamental data structure concepts and failed to provide any answer to the recursive algorithm question, indicating significant gaps in basic understanding."
